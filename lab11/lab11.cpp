Step 1. Set the variables,
	Score- S
	Random number to try to guess- X
	Minimum number to choose between- Min
	Maximum number to choose between- Max
Step 2. Output the possible numbers to choose from
Step 3. User chooses a number 
Step 4. Determine if the number is higher than, lower than, or equal to the variable X chosen
Step 5 if the number is higher than the random number eliminate all numbers higher or equal to the chosen number and change the max variable to the appropriate max value,  also subtract 1 from the variable score, if it is lower do the opposite but also subtract 1 from the variable score, if it equal output you win.
(If needed) Step 6 repeat from step 2 until the number is guessed.
