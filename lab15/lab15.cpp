Large Lion jumping upand down in its tree. 
He Ran quicklythrough the large tunnel that
led to its short Dog. I got some peanuts and
passed them through the cage to a gigantic gray 
Monkey towering above my head. Feeding that
animal made me hungry.I went to get a Crazy scoop
of ice cream. It filled my stomach. Afterwards I 
had to jump quietly to catch our bus. When I got 
home I threw my mom for a luckyday at the zoo.
